# 3D_Game_Engine
A basic 3D game Engine to render Shapes,Meshes. Scale and Rotate them in runtime.

A layer over DirectX9.
Need to install DirectX9 sdk.

Support for various shapes can be added in the engine.
Uses Singleton pattern.

Source.cpp is the driver code for the engine.
Render.cpp is where magic happens.
